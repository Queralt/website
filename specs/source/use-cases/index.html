A <em>credential</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of 
information about an entity’s background such as a name, government ID, 
payment provider, home address, or university degree.
The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward 
possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and 
high-stakes credentials with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving 
digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements. 
The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created 
by the group should address.

    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>
A <em>credential</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of 
information about an entity’s background such as a name, government ID, 
payment provider, home address, or university degree.
The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward 
possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and 
high-stakes credentials with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving 
digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements. 
The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created

Create a better introduction to the use cases.

  <section>
    <h2>Glossary</h2>
  
    <p>
There is certain terminology used throughout this document that has a very
specific meaning. In order to state explicitly what that meaning is, the 
following definitions are provided:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>entity</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
or instance of a software program.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of information about an 
<tref title="entity">entity’s</tref> background such as a name, government ID, 
payment processor, home address, or university degree.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential exchange</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a transmission of a credential from one <tref>entity</tref> to another 
<tref>entity</tref>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
  
    <p>
Each interaction in a Credentials scenario involves a number of 
<tref title="entity">entities</tref>. In order to make it clear who the
actors are, the following roles are defined:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>credentialee</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is in control of a particular 
<tref>credential</tref>. Typically an credentialee is also the primary topic 
of the information in a credential and is the entity that initiates the 
transmission of the credential.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>issuer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that creates and assigns 
<tref title="credential">credentials</tref> to 
<tref title="credentialee">credentialees</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>requestor</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that requests a <tref>credential</tref> from an
<tref>credentialee</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>user agent</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between the <tref>credentialee</tref> and
the <tref>requestor</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential service</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a program, such as a <tref>credential</tref> storage vault or personal 
credential wallet, that stores and protects access to an 
<tref title="credentialee">credentialee's</tref> credentials.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
  
    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use 
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall credentials system.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Data Portability</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure credentials may be easily moved from one <tref>credential service</tref> 
to another.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Data Rights</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure credentials may be dynamically annotated with acceptable use information
when transmitted to <tref title="requestor">requestors</tref>.
      </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Legacy Support</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure the Credentials solution can provide an abstraction layer that 
integrates with existing credentialing methods 
(eg: email, username/passwords, etc.)
      </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Reuse and Extend</h2> 
   
      <p>
Consider using existing, widely deployed identity provider mechanisms (e.g. 
Facebook Connect, OpenID Connect, G+ Sign-In, etc.) to integrate with the 
credential sharing process. Only invent a new mechanism if the current identity 
provider mechanisms do not provide the functionality necessary to achieve 
the use cases promoted by the group.

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
The following use cases outline scenarios that are targeted to be supported
in the set of Credentials 1.0 specifications.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Storage</h2> 
   
      <p>
Store a basic credential via the Web in a way that is easy to share with 
various requestors given authorization by the credentialee, 
and in a way that is easy to synchronize between devices.

            <li>
Transferring a <tref>credential</tref> from one device to another MUST be 
specified and MUST be <tref>credentialee</tref> initiated.
            </li>
            <li>
Transmitting a <tref>credential</tref> from a <tref>credential service</tref>

      <h2>Transmission</h2> 
   
      <p>
Steve (credentialee) visits a merchant website (requestor) and authorizes the 
transmission of one or more credentials (such as proof-of-age, 
shipping address, etc.) previously stored with a credential service to the 
merchant to enable access or fulfillment of a transaction.

      <h2>Pre-Authorization</h2> 
   
      <p>
Given the opt-in permission of the <tref>credentialee</tref> an identity
URL may be used to discover additional attributes associated with the
credentialee. For example, given a buyer's (credentialee) authorization, a 
merchant (requestor) could query the identity URL for the buyer contained 
in a digital receipt and obtain an up-to-date email address in order to send
them a product recall notice.

Digitally verifiable credentials such that a merchant (requestor) and 
payment processor (requestor) involved in a financial transaction can prove 
that they have performed the proper due diligence when identifying the 
payer (credentialee) and the payee (credentialee). This class of regulatory
requirement is known as "Know Your Customer (KYC)".

proof-of-age instead of a date of birth to the website.

Gunther (credentialee) enters a short-identifier that he believes identifies The 
Widget Store (credentialee) into a UI. The UI displays a certificate of 
authenticity that indicates the short identifier is in fact for The Widget 
Store. Gunther uses the short identifier to make a payment to the store.
