information about an entity’s background such as a name, government ID, 
payment provider, home address, or university degree.
The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward 
possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and 
high-stakes credentials with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving 
digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements. 
The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created 
by the group should address.

    <h2>Glossary</h2>
  
    <p>
There is certain terminology used throughout this document that has a very
specific meaning. In order to state explicitly what that meaning is, the 
following definitions are provided:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>entity</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
or instance of a software program.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of information about an 
<tref title="entity">entity’s</tref> background such as a name, government ID, 
payment processor, home address, or university degree.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential exchange</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a transmission of a credential from one <tref>entity</tref> to another 
<tref>entity</tref>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
  
    <p>
Each interaction in a Credentials scenario involves a number of 
<tref title="entity">entities</tref>. In order to make it clear who the
actors are, the following roles are defined:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>credentialee</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is in control of a particular 
<tref>credential</tref>. Typically an credentialee is also the primary topic 
of the information in a credential and is the entity that initiates the 
transmission of the credential.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>issuer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that creates and assigns 
<tref title="credential">credentials</tref> to 
<tref title="credentialee">credentialees</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>requestor</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that requests a <tref>credential</tref> from an
<tref>credentialee</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>user agent</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between the <tref>credentialee</tref> and
the <tref>requestor</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential service</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a program, such as a <tref>credential</tref> storage vault or personal 
credential wallet, that stores and protects access to an 
<tref title="credentialee">credentialee's</tref> credentials.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
  
    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use 
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall credentials system.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Data Portability</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure credentials may be easily moved from one <tref>credential service</tref> 
to another.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Yannos has been storing all of his credentials at his college credential service
and, upon graduating, would like to move them to a more long-term storage 
service. All of the credentials are moved without having to re-issue or 
re-assign any of the credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Data Rights</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure credentials may be dynamically annotated with acceptable use information
when transmitted to <tref title="requestor">requestors</tref>.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Rosa is transmitting her email address to a group buying website and wants to
ensure that her email address will not be used for unsolicited emails. She
attaches a "no advertising" assertion to her email credential to
ensure that it isn't re-transmitted to 3rd parties for advertising purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Legacy Support</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure the Credentials solution can provide an abstraction layer that 
integrates with existing authentication methods 
(eg: email, username/passwords, etc.)
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Petra goes to login to a website, but does not have any credentials. She does,
however, have a username/password based account on the website. She is able to
bypass the credential-based login and use a username/password login instead.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <section> 
      <h2>Flexible Access Control</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure that a <tref>credentialee</tref> may provide access to their credentials
in an interactive and non-interactive manner. Access granted by the credentilee
may be revoked at a later time by the credentialee.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Ralph is buying wine at an online wine store. The wine store interactively 
requests a proof-of-age and shipping address credential from Ralph before 
completing the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
The Good Food grocery store requests non-interactive access to each of their
customer's email credentials when they sign up for a loyalty card. If a
product recall notice is ever issued for an item a customer purchased, the
latest email address for the customer is fetched and the product recall notice
is forwarded to the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
Jackie allows TrustMart to automatically retrieve her latest address and phone
credentials. She then recieves unsolicited junkmail that she knows came from
TrustMart. She deauthorizes TrustMart from pulling her latest address and phone
credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Reuse and Extend</h2> 
   
      <p>
Consider using existing, widely deployed identity provider mechanisms (e.g. 
Facebook Connect, OpenID Connect, G+ Sign-In, etc.) to integrate with the 
credential sharing process. Only invent a new mechanism if the current identity 
provider mechanisms do not provide the functionality necessary to achieve 
the use cases promoted by the group.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Charlie uses an OpenID Connect login process to login to a website, which also
transmits his credential service URL. The website uses the credential service
URL to request additional credentials that the website needs to verify his
education credentials.
          </li>

      <h2>Identifier Alignment</h2> 
   
      <p>
Enable credentials to be issued by systems in a way that allows each system 
to align their internal identifiers with the other.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Virginia Tech (a university) and the US Department of Education would like to
update the loan status of a particular individual. Both systems support 
credentials, but neither of them desire to use the universal identity URL in
their internal systems (due to legacy system limitations). Both systems use a
common internal identifier, such as a loan ID embedded in a credential, to 
align the data in both systems with the other.
          </li>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
The following use cases outline scenarios that are targeted to be supported
in the set of Credentials 1.0 specifications.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Verifiable Claims</h2> 
   
      <p>
A <tref>requestor</tref> cryptographically verifies that an 
<tref>issuer</tref> has made a particular set of claims about an 
<tref>entity</tref>. A claim would consist of an assertion about a particular
qualification, achievement, or attribute of the entity.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
          <ul> 
            <li>
A university would like to verify that an incoming student has achieved an
acceptable score on the SAT by verifying their score report with Educational
Testing Service (ETS).
            </li>
            <li>
A bank would like to perform "Know Your Customer" clearing on a new customer 
by checking to see that they are a citizen of Finland and that they have
a current national ID card issued to them by their government.
            </li>
            <li>
A hospital would like to ensure that a prospective employee is licensed to
practice medicine in their state as well as having up-to-date certificates
related to areas of specialization.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </section> 

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 

        <p>
This is the base use case for the credentials work. It establishes the need for
a way of making claims about an entity and then digitally signing those claims
such that the claims are cryptographically verifiable.

      <h2>Composability</h2> 
   
      <p>
Multiple credentials from multiple issuers are composed together to grant 
authorization to access a system.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Marisol wants to open a bank account at a new bank. The bank requires two 
valid forms of identification. She uses a US Password credential and a 
Colorado drivers license credential to prove that she is who she says she 
is to the bank.
          </li>
          <li>
Harpreet needs to access a secure Department of Defense facility. He provides

      <h2>Endorsements</h2> 
   
      <p>
A credential may be endorsed/counter-signed by one or more entities.
Signatures can be either dependent on one another (chained together), or 
multiple signatures on original credential (part of a mathematical Set).
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
MidBank is attempting to establish a solid credit rating and hires three credit
ratings agencies to audit its books. Each firm determines that the bank should
have a AA credit rating and digitally countersigns the same credential 3 times
to demonstrate the credit worthiness of the bank.
          </li>
          <li>
Two people get married and get a marriage credential which needs to be
digitally signed by the person that married them and the witness, in that order.
The credential is first issued by the person that married them, and is then
counter-signed by the witness.
          </li>

      <h2>Pseudo-anonymity</h2> 
   
      <p>
Access a restricted area of a website using a credential without revealing 
any personally identifying information. Personally identifying information is 
available to law enforcement via a court order.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Roman would like to purchase access to an adult website without revealing any
personally identifying information. He transmits an age verification credential
and an an email mixnet credential to the merchant. The merchant is not able
to use that information to identify Roman.

      <h2>Identity Aliases</h2> 
   
      <p>
A <tref>credentialee</tref> uses a short-identifier text string to lookup
an <tref>entity</tref> identity URL.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Gunther enters a short-identifier that he believes identifies The Smart Store 
into a UI. The UI displays a certificate of authenticity that indicates the 
short identifier is in fact for The Smart Store. Gunther uses the short 
identifier to make a payment to the store. The short identifier is expanded to
an identity URL and then the identity URL is used to determine the primary
payment account for the identity URL.
