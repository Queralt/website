A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
payment provider, home address, or university degree.
The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements.
The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created
by the group should address.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
      <p>This document is an early version being used as an integration point for 
      a variety of use cases assembled from throughout the industry.  As the document
      becomes more mature this status will be updated accordingly.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Task Force at the W3C is investigating
    the requirements around secure, verifiable, and richly descriptive
    "<a>claims</a>".  The goal of the Task Force is to determine if
    there is a sufficient understanding and need to merit the creation
    of a W3C Working Group to develop Recommendations in this space.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Having said that, its very
        structure reflects some assumptions about how claims might be
        used in the real world.  These assumptions are
        derived from the use cases, not vice-versa.  Any solution that
        satisfies the complete collection of essential use cases would
        meet the requirements reflected by this document.
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this Work</h3>

        <p>People need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday lives.  
        As more important business moves to the Internet, people need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims about their
        accomplishments and qualifications. From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize users to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human-mediated decisions about job applications, collaboration
        and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data about individuals'
        experience and accomplishments. 
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Read This Document</h3>
        <p>This document is organized around the basic operations that
        might be performed on a Verifiable Claim.  For each of these
        operations, and for the additional section "Uncategorized /
        General", the document captures some high level use cases
        grouped by the requirement they represent.
        Each use case contains information about its motivation, relative
        priority, and one or more examples to help define the target
        beneficiaries of its support.

      <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Used</h2>
      <p>Just to provide a basis for discussion, this section
      illustrates a simple example of how a claim might be used in a
      typical commerce situation.  Please remember that it is just an
      example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
      a system must be implemented.  First, consider this diagram:</p>
      <img alt='Example Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
      <ol>
          <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site 
          WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
          <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
          requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
          <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>claim vault</a> for the
          proof.</li>
          <li>The <a>claim vault</a> shows her three Verifiable Claims
          it knows of that
          can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
          license, and birth certificate).</li>
          <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
          shared with the merchant.</li>
          <li>The claim vault returns the selected claim as a response
          to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
          it to the merchant.</li>
          <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
          and satisfies the requirement.</li>
          <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
          with appropriate authorization.</li>

    <h2>An Overview of Phases of Credential Usage</h2>

    <p>While the credentials specifications are intended to allow for their use in a variety of industries and scenarios, there are consistent phases to the procedure as defined below.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Issuing Credentials</li>
      <li>Storing Credentials</li>
      <li>Managing Credentials</li>
      <li>Consuming Credentials</li>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>

    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall credentials system.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Portability</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be easily moved from one <a>credential service</a>
to another.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Yannos has been storing all of his credentials at his college credential service
and, upon graduating, would like to move them to a more long-term storage
service. All of the credentials are moved without having to re-issue or
re-assign any of the credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Rights</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be dynamically annotated with acceptable use information
when transmitted to <a>credential consumers</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Rosa is transmitting her email address to a group buying website and wants to
ensure that her email address will not be used for unsolicited emails. She
attaches a "no advertising" assertion to her email credential to
ensure that it isn't re-transmitted to 3rd parties for advertising purposes.
          </li>

      <h2>Legacy Support</h2>

      <p>
Ensure the Credentials solution can provide an abstraction layer that
integrates with existing authentication methods
(eg: email, username/passwords, etc.)
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Petra goes to login to a website, but does not have any credentials. She does,
however, have a username/password based account on the website. She is able to
bypass the credential-based login and use a username/password login instead.

      <h2>Flexible Access Control</h2>

      <p>
Ensure that a <a>recipient</a> may provide access to their credentials
in an interactive and non-interactive manner. Access granted by the credentilee
may be revoked at a later time by the <a>recipient</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Ralph is buying wine at an online wine store. The wine store interactively
requests a proof-of-age and shipping address credential from Ralph before
completing the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
The Good Food grocery store requests non-interactive access to each of their
customer's email credentials when they sign up for a loyalty card. If a
product recall notice is ever issued for an item a customer purchased, the
latest email address for the customer is fetched and the product recall notice
is forwarded to the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
Jackie allows TrustMart to automatically retrieve her latest address and phone
credentials. She then receives unsolicited junkmail that she knows came from
TrustMart. She deauthorizes TrustMart from pulling her latest address and phone
credentials.
          </li>

      <h2>Reuse and Extend</h2>

      <p>
Consider using existing, widely deployed identity provider mechanisms (e.g.
Facebook Connect, OpenID Connect, G+ Sign-In, etc.) to integrate with the
credential sharing process. Only invent a new mechanism if the current identity
provider mechanisms do not provide the functionality necessary to achieve
the use cases promoted by the group.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Charlie uses an OpenID Connect login process to login to a website, which also
transmits his credential service URL. The website uses the credential service
URL to request additional credentials that the website needs to verify his
education credentials.

      <h2>Identifier Alignment</h2>

      <p>
Enable credentials to be issued by systems in a way that allows each system
to align their internal identifiers with the other.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Virginia Tech (a university) and the US Department of Education would like to
update the loan status of a particular individual. Both systems support
credentials, but neither of them desire to use the universal identity URL in
their internal systems (due to legacy system limitations). Both systems use a
common internal identifier, such as a loan ID embedded in a credential, to
align the data in both systems with the other.

    A credential may be endorsed/counter-signed by one or more entities.
    Signatures can be either dependent on one another (chained together), or
    multiple signatures on original credential (part of a mathematical Set).

  MidBank is attempting to establish a solid credit rating and hires three credit
  ratings agencies to audit its books. Each firm determines that the bank should
  have a AA credit rating and digitally countersigns the same credential 3 times
  to demonstrate the credit worthiness of the bank.

            <li>
  Two people get married and get a marriage credential which needs to be
  digitally signed by the person that married them and the witness, in that order.
  The credential is first issued by the person that married them, and is then
  counter-signed by the witness.

  A learner named Olivia is choosing among summer internships, some of which
  offer opportunities to earn badges that are endorsed by her school. These are
  badges that could be used to fulfill an interest-driven learning graduation
  requirement her district has recently implemented. With the additional
  information provided to her by the school’s endorsement of certain badges,
  her choice among internships is made much simpler. This example came from the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzJXInqZCVft432_yFlKC4YIQZs_fv3zEX8Mfh4G6XY/edit">Open Badges Endorsement Framework Working Paper</a>,

  Horizon Learning (HL) develops healthcare professional development modules.
  Health Education Alliance (HEA) is an industry association that provides
  professional development rating services for providers and specific learning
  modules. Emily works at Health Services International (HSI) and needs to take
  professional development courses. Her company pays 50% of the cost for modules
  she takes if they are endorsed by HEA.

  The last two examples are using a different definition of "endorsement" than
  the first two examples. The first two examples use a more technical definition,
  which is "endorsement as a layering or multiple signatures on a single
  credential (aka: the service provided by a notary public or witness)".
  The last two examples use a more functional definition, which is

  means, or use other language that won't confuse readers (or both).
