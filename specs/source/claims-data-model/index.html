An <a>identity profile</a> is a collection of attributes about
an <a>entity</a> that distinguish it from other entities. Entities are
anything with distinct existence, such as people, organizations,
concepts, or devices. Some entities, such as people, are multifaceted,
having multiple identities (profiles) that they present to the
world. People are often able to establish trust by demonstrating that
respected others have made claims about their identities. One way of
doing this is by presenting an <a>entity credential</a>. An <a>entity
credential</a> is a set of <a>claims</a> made by an <a>entity</a>
about an <a>identity profile</a> referred to as the <a>subject</a> of
the claims. An <a>entity credential</a> may refer to a qualification,
achievement, quality, or other information about the <a>subject</a>
such as a name, government ID, home address, or university degree that
typically indicates suitability.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification describes a data model for a digital <a>identity
profile</a> and a collection of digital <a>entity credentials</a> that
assert <a>claims</a> about that <a>identity profile</a>. It also
describes how to express that data model in JSON, JSON-LD, and WebIDL.

      <p>Drawn initially from
      [[IDENTITY-CREDENTIALS]], this
      document is intended to provide a rough outline of the kind of
      standardization work that a Verifiable Claims Working Group
      might do.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      We typically use credentials, or claims made by
      others about our identities, to authenticate ourselves and
      ultimately gain access to various services. For example, we use
      email addresses to identify ourselves to online services,
      driver's licenses to prove that we are capable of operating a
      motor vehicle, university degrees to prove we are well-trained
      and knowledgeable, and government-issued passports to travel
      between countries or to access financial services. It is the
      goal of this specification to provide an easy, standard way to
      express such credentials on the Web.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are a number of desirable capabilities for these kinds of
      credentials, referred to in this specification as <a>entity
      credentials</a>, that have been identified as requirements for
      this specification:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Entity credentials</a> are user-centric. This refers to an architecture where:
          <ul>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders are positioned in the middle between issuers and consumers.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders receive and store credentials from issuers through an
agent that the issuer does not need to trust.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders provide credentials to credential consumers through
an agent that consumers needn't trust; they only need to trust issuers.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credentials</a> are associated with identities, not particular services; credential
holders can decide how to aggregate credentials and manage their own
identities.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders can control and own their own identifiers.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders can control which credentials to use and when.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders may freely choose and swap out the agents they employ to
help them manage and share their credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders that share verifiable claims are not required to reveal the
identity of the consumer to their agent or to issuers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
A standard, machine-readable data format for expressing <a>entity credentials</a>
that can be extended with minimal coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
Independent issuance, storage, and cryptographic verification of <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A standard mechanism for requesting <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The ability to revoke previously issued <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Web Browser APIs for storing and consuming <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This specification is based upon work presented in
      [[IDENTITY-CREDENTIALS]].  In particular, examples from that
      document have been used to infer a simple but extensible data
      model capable of representing the unbounded variety
      of attributes that could be claimed in <a>entity
      credentials</a>.  This document is intended to provide only one
      example of what could potentially be defined and standardized in
      a Recommendation-track Working Group at W3C.  The two pieces of
      possible standardization work demonstrated in this document
      are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A generic data model covering the minimum information
        necessary to create and use <a>entity credentials</a> that
        would meet the needs described in the [[\Use Cases
        Document]].</li>
        <li>Instructions on how to express specific instances of the
        data model in three different syntactic formulations: JSON,
        JSON-LD, and WebIDL.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The remainder of this specification is structured as follows:
first, some general definitions of terms are provided.  Second, the
data model is described in text prose to avoid any suggestion of bias
in terms of syntactic representation.  It is also presented as a UML
diagram. Third, instructions are provided for how to express instances
of the data model in terms of JSON, JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]], and
WebIDL.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>General Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Both the <a>Identity Profile Model</a> and <a>Entity
        Credential Model</a> consist of a collection of name-value
        pairs which will be referred to as
        <dfn data-lt="property">properties</dfn> in this document.
        The following subsections describe the required and optional
        properties for both.  The link between the two is in
        the <var>id</var> property.  The <a>Identity Profile Model</a>
        defines a <a>subject</a> identifier in
        the <a href="#identity-id"><var>id</var></a> property, while
        the claims section of the <a>Entity Credential Model</a> uses
        the <a href="#claim-id"><var>id</var></a> property to refer to
        that <a>subject</a> identifier.</p>
        <p>This document purposely defines the data model without
        using a concrete syntax such as WebIDL, JSON, or JSON-LD to
        avoid implying a bias towards any particular one syntax.
        Section <a href="#expressing-identity-profiles-entity-credentials-and-verifiable-claims"></a>
        defines how the data model is to be expressed in those
        representation languages.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><dfn>Identity Profile Model</dfn></h2>
        <p>Unlike the <a>properties</a> in
        the <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a> section of
        the <a>Entity Credential Model</a>, the <a>properties</a> in
        the Identity Profile Model are merely information that,
        together with a <a>subject</a>
        identifier <a href="#identity-id"><var>id</var></a>,
        constitute an identity profile.  The properties are not claims
        and are not intended to be verifiable.</p>
        <p>The following properties are required in the Identity
        Profile Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><a id="identity-id"><var>id</var></a></dt>
          <dd>This is a URI representing the <a>subject</a>.  This
          identifier MAY be long-lived but does not have to be.</dd>
          <dt><var>type</var></dt>
          <dd>This is an unordered set of URIs representing the types
          or classes of which this data set is a member.  As an
          <a>identity profile</a>, at a minimum the class "Identity"
          must be a member of the set.  Additional
          application-specific values are permitted in the set.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The following properties are optional in the Identity
        Profile Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>signature</var></dt>
          <dd>The method used for a signature will vary by
          representation language.  However, if present this property
          is expected to have a value that is a set of name-value
          pairs including at least a signature, a reference to the
          signing entity, and a representation of the signing
          date.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Additionally, any property name not listed above is
        permitted as an optional custom <a>property</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Entity Credential Model</h2>
        <p>Unlike the <a>properties</a> in the <a>Identity Profile
        Model</a>, the <a>properties</a> in
        the <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a> section of the
        Entity Credential Model are claims made by an <a>entity</a>
        about the <a>subject</a> defined in an <a>identity
        profile</a>.  The Entity Credential Model includes both
        issuance-related properties and the
        aforementioned <a href="ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a>
        property that further contains the properties of the claim
        itself.</p>
        <p>The following properties are required in the Entity
        Credential Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>id</var></dt>
          <dd>URI representing this specific <a>entity credential</a></dd>
          <dt><var>type</var></dt>
          <dd>This is an unordered set of URIs representing the types
          or classes of which this data set is a member.  As an
          <a>entity credential</a>, at a minimum the class
          "Credential" must be a member of the set.  Additional
          application-specific values are permitted in the
          set.</dd>
          <dt><a id="ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a></dt>
          <dd>This is the actual claim.  Its value is a set of
          <a>properties</a> as follows:
            <p>The following properties are required in

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express
            an <a>entity credential</a> containing a simple
            (unverifiable) <a>claim</a> about a particular
            <a>subject</a>. In this case, the claim is that
            the <a>subject</a> with
            the <a href="#identity-id">Identity
            Profile <var>id</var></a> of
            <code>did:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21</code> is 21 years
            of age or older. While a human reading the
            property <code>ageOver</code> may be able to guess its
            meaning by its name, no machine-readable semantics for the
            name are provided. There is information about the <a>claim</a>
            itself, such as an identifier for the <a>entity</a> that issued
            it and a date for when it was issued. </p>

<pre class="idl">
  interface CredentialBase {
    attribute DOMString id;
    attribute FrozenArray&lt;DOMString> type;
    attribute DOMString issuer;
    attribute DOMString issued;
  };

  [Constructor]
  interface Credential : CredentialBase {
    attribute Claim1 claim;
  };

  [Constructor]
  interface Claim1 {
    attribute DOMString id;
    attribute unsigned short ageOver;
  };
</pre>

            <p>This <a>entity credential expression</a> could then be
            used as follows in JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="example" title="Using a simple claim">
  var claim = new Claim1();
  claim.id = "http://example.gov/credentials/3732";
  claim.ageOver = 21;

  var credential = new Credential();
  credential.type = ["Credential", "ProofOfAgeCredential"];
  credential.issuer = "https://dmv.example.gov";
  credential.issued = "2010-01-01";
  credential.claim = claim;
</pre>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express the
            same <a>claim</a> about the same <a>subject</a>, but in a
            verifiable form. As such, it contains
            a <code>signature</code> that can be used to verify its
            entire contents, including the claim.</p>

<pre class="idl">
  interface VerifiableCredentialBase : CredentialBase {
    attribute Signature signature;
  };

  [Constructor]
  interface Signature {
    attribute DOMString type;
    attribute DOMString creator;
    attribute DOMString signature;
  };

  [Constructor]
  interface VerifiableCredential1 : VerifiableCredentialBase {
    attribute Claim1 claim;
  };
</pre>
            <p>This verifiable <a>entity credential expression</a>
            could then be used as follows in JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="example" title="Using a simple verifiable claim">
  var claim = new Claim1();
  claim.id = "http://example.gov/credentials/3732";
  claim.ageOver = 21;

  var signature = new Signature();

  signature.creator = "https://dmv.example.gov/keys/6";
  signature.signature = "2332f32g43ve23g23g23g/g3223gegvgre212fb488vh";

  var credential = new VerifiableCredential1();
  credential.type = ["Credential", "ProofOfAgeCredential"];
  credential.issuer = "https://dmv.example.gov";
  credential.issued = "2010-01-01";
  credential.claim = claim;

The following example demonstrates how to express a more complex set
of verfiable claims about a particular <a>subject</a>.
