    <p>This document is the architecture vision statment of the W3C Credentials Community Group. It describes the principles upon which a Credentials architecture should be built.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">mission</a> of the Credentials Community Group is to standardize a mechanism for exchanging provably-authentic claims via the Web. Examples of claims may be qualifications, achievements, qualities, or pieces of information about an entity such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree.</p>

    <h2>Web Principles</h2>
    <p>
Any architecture grounded in the Web should respect well-known Web principles such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adhering to Web architecture fundamentals,</li>
      <li>Supporting network independence,</li>
      <li>Supporting device independence,</li>
      <li>Providing accessibility for <a>issuers</a> and <a>requestors</a> with disabilities,</li>
      <li>Being machine-readable where possible to enable automation and engagement of non-human entities,</li>
      <li>Protecting the privacy of all participants, and</li>
      <li>Being open and usable by anyone, including those who are not yet connected to the Web.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desireable properties of a Credentials Architecture</h2>
    <p class="ednote">put the goals from exec summary here?</p>
    <p>
A number of W3C member organizations are proposing the creation of a new standardization activity around credentials on the Web with the following goals in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interoperability</strong> and <strong>Portability</strong>. We want to ensure that an open credential can be used by as broad of a range of organizations as possible. We firmly support the notion that a recipient of a credential should be able to store, archive, and migrate credentials throughout their lifetime with relative ease.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability</strong>. The credentialing solution should be usable by the 3 billion people using the Web today, and the 6 billion people that will be using the Web by the year 2020.</li>
      <li><strong>Verifiability</strong>. The veracity of claims made by a credential should be verifiable using the credential itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy Enhancing</strong> and <strong>Recipient Controlled</strong>. We want a system that protects the privacy of the individual or organization using the credential by placing the recipient in control of who is allowed to access their credential.</li>
      <li><strong>Extensible</strong>. Our desire is to construct a foundation where different industry vertical-specific solutions can be built without unnecessary central coordination.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessible</strong>. The credentialing solution should be accessible and therefore also usable by the 10% of the world population with disabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Patent and Royalty-free</strong>. We are building public infrastructure whose growth should not be limited by patents and royalties. Credentials affect everyone and the technology to create them must be open and free.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the principles above, the following are desirable properties specific to a Credentials architecture:</p>
